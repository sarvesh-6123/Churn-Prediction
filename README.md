This project aims to analyze the churn rate of a telecom company, Orange S.A., and identify the factors that contribute to customer churn. The dataset used in this analysis is the Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, which includes cleaned customer activity data and a churn label indicating whether a customer cancelled their subscription.

## Problem Statement  
Telecom companies often struggle with customer churn, which refers to the number of customers who leave the company over a given period. In this project, we aimed to analyze the churn rate of a telecom company and identify the factors that contribute to customer churn.
  
## Business Objective
The primary business objective of this project is twofold:

-> Identify the key factors contributing to customer churn: By analyzing the customer activity data, we aim to identify patterns and correlations that indicate why customers are cancelling their subscriptions. This understanding will help Orange Telecom take proactive measures to reduce churn.

-> Provide recommendations for customer retention: Based on the analysis results, we will propose actionable recommendations to Orange Telecom for retaining valuable customers. These recommendations may include targeted marketing campaigns, improved customer service, or service enhancements to address identified pain points.
